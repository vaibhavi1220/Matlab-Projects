# 2D DFT in Image Filtering
<b>Low pass Filter:</b>
<br/>
A low-pass filter is a filter that passes signals with a frequency lower than a selected cutoff frequency and attenuates signals with frequencies higher than the cutoff frequency.


Implementation of 1D Fast Fourier Transform and 2D Fast Fourier transform and applying the Ideal low pass filter.
