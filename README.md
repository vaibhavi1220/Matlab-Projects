# Matlab-Projects

This folder contains three projects completed during my course of Image Processing

1) Image-Noise-Models-
Generated Uniform and Salt-and-pepper noise models for an image

2) 2D DFT in Image Filtering
<b><br/>Low pass Filter:</b>
<br/>A low-pass filter is a filter that passes signals with a frequency lower than a selected cutoff frequency and attenuates signals with frequencies higher than the cutoff frequency.
Implementation of 1D Fast Fourier Transform and 2D Fast Fourier transform and applying the Ideal low pass filter.

3) Digital-Image-Re-Sampling
Re-sampling of a 2D Image

Dimensions for the images
Downscale : 200 150  
Upscale : 400 450
